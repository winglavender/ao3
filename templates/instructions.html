    <h2>
      Provide Your AO3 Login Info
    </h2>

    <p>
      In order to retrieve your stats from AO3, you will need to provide your AO3 username and password. This information is used once to access your specific AO3 history, and is not stored or saved in any way.

    <h2>
      Wait for App to Run
    </h2>

    <p>
      In order to build a summary, the app has to load every page in your history for the specified year. This takes time,
      especially if you read a lot of fics that year. It may take 5 minutes or
      more to download 100 pages of history, for example. It may take longer if many people are using the app simultaneously. Please be patient!
