    <h2>
      Provide Your AO3 Login Info
    </h2>

    <p>
      In order to retrieve your stats from AO3, you will need to provide your
      username and your _otwarchive_session cookie to fill in the USERNAME and
      COOKIE fields.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you are using the Chrome browser from a computer, you can find your
      cookie value as follows. There should be a similar process for other
      browsers, but it may be difficult to access this information if you are
      currently using a mobile device.
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        Load any archiveofyourown.org page while logged in to your account.
      </li>
      <li>
        Right click anywhere on the page and select "Inspect" from the menu.
      </li>
      <li>On the upper menu bar, click Application.</li>
      <li>
        Find the row in the table with Name _otwarchive_session. Copy the
        contents of Value into the COOKIE field.
      </li>
      <li>
        If you see the "Login error" message, then the app wasn't able to log in
        using the username/cookie you provided. The most likely reason for this
        is that the cookie has refreshed and has a different value now. You
        should repeat the above steps and copy the new value into the COOKIE
        field.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <h2>
      Wait for Script to Run
    </h2>

    <p>
      The app has to load every page in your history for the specified year in
      order to collect the relevant data to build your summary. This takes time,
      especially if you read a lot of fics that year. It may take 3 minutes or
      more to download 70 pages of history.
