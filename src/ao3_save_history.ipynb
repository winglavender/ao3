    "\n",
    "### How to Use\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Provide Your AO3 Login Info\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to retrieve your stats from AO3, you will need to provide your username and your _otwarchive_session cookie to fill in the USERNAME and COOKIE fields on line 5 of the cell below (you will need to keep the quotes around your username and cookie).\n",
    "\n",
    "In Chrome, you can find your cookie value as follows:\n",
    "1. Load any archiveofyourown.org page.\n",
    "2. Right click anywhere on the page and select \"Inspect\" from the menu.\n",
    "3. On the upper menu bar, click Application.\n",
    "4. Find the row in the table with Name _otwarchive_session. Copy the contents of Value into the below cell in place of COOKIE (keep the quotes).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you see the \"Login error\" message, then the app wasn't able to log in using the username/cookie you provided. The most likely reason for this is that the cookie has refreshed and has a different value now. You should repeat the above steps and copy the new value into the COOKIE field. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Run the Script\n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've filled in your login info, go to \"Cell\" -> \"Run All\" in the menu. That should start downloading your AO3 history. Watch out for any login errors. If you have other issues you can contact winglavender@gmail.com and I'll try to address them. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Runtime \n",
    "\n",
    "The whole process should be relatively quick, depending on how many works are in your history. It takes a couple minutes to go through ~50 pages of history, in my experience.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Mobile\n",
    "\n",
    "This has not been tested on mobile. I'd recommend running the downloader from a computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Timeout Warning\n",
    "\n",
    "If you're running this notebook in Binder on your browser, be aware that your session will time out after only 10 minutes of inactivity. So once the script has finished running, you should download the results file right away - if you let it sit for too long, the notebook will shut down and you'll have to run it again from script in order to get your results."
