This is a webapp that downloads the data from your Archive Of Our Own history for a particular year and produces a summary of what you read (total words read, most visited fics, most common ships and tags, etc). It also generates a spreadsheet that you can download to see your reading history in more detail.

It is built on a fork of ladyofthelog's ao3 package (which is a fork of alexwlchan's no-longer-maintained ao3 package). 

**********

This Python package provides a scripted interface to some of the data on
`AO3 <https://archiveofourown.org/>`_ (the Archive of Our Own).

It is **not** an official API.

This package no longer is compatible with Py2.
